//! A fixed-size pool of real OS threads that pull work off one shared FIFO-
//! ish queue, one item at a time each. Built to replace `main.zig`'s old
//! reliance on Zig 0.16's implicit, process-wide `Io.Threaded` instance
//! (constructed by the runtime itself in `std/start.zig`, before `root.main`
//! ever runs, with no way for warden to configure it) for per-message
//! concurrency.
//!
//! That implicit pool bounds `Io.Group.async`/`Io.concurrent` to
//! `cpu_count - 1` concurrently-running slots (`Io/Threaded.zig`'s
//! `async_limit`) — confirmed live on the production VPS to be **0** on its
//! single vCPU. Once that bound is hit, a further `.async()` call doesn't
//! queue: it runs the task *synchronously inline on the calling thread*
//! instead. Since every connector's poll loop is the thread that calls
//! `.async()` for its own incoming messages, this meant per-message
//! concurrency was already completely defeated on that host — every message
//! ran serially, inline, on the poll loop's own thread — so a single stuck
//! message (an unbounded blocking call somewhere inside it) froze that
//! connector's poll loop, and therefore that whole platform, permanently.
//!
//! `WorkerPool` sidesteps this by owning its threads outright instead of
//! sharing Zig's implicit pool, sized off detected CPU count with a floor of
//! 2 (see `config.zig`'s `defaultWorkersPerPlatform`) rather than a hidden,
//! unconfigurable, and — on small hosts — degenerate value. A stuck item now
//! occupies exactly one of N worker threads; the other N-1 keep draining the
//! queue, and `push` itself never blocks on processing at all, so the
//! connector's poll loop is never at risk of being blocked by backlog either
//! way.
